Unemployment is the biggest problem in Bangladesh now a days. So, the remote job can solve this problem because during COVID 19 people are familiar with the term work from home. It is efficient and cost effective. Remote job is the future but in Bangladesh there are not any particular app or website for this.
There are multiple international apps like fiverr or upwork but they cut a huge amount of amount and payment procedure is not so friendly for us. So, We mainly focus on the freelancer and unemployed persons who have been well qualified and the company or the client give post for the work. Anyone who is eligible can apply and the buyer will admit him for the specific work.
